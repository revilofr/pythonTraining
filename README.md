# pythonTraining
Purpose of this repository is to share exercises made by my studdents.
Thoses exercices are really basic, there is always a better way to do it, but the goal is to progress with what they know.

Feel free to copy those exerices for your own studdents and to adapt it.
The training slides will be available soon
